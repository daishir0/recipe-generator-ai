# recipe-generator-ai
Recipe Generator AI is a Python application that uses OpenAI's Vision and Chat APIs to analyze food ingredients from images and generate creative recipes. The program can extract ingredients (including quantities and prices) from supermarket flyers or food images, then create both traditional and fusion recipes using the identified ingredients.
